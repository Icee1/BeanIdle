# BeanIdle
quick idle game I made, get beans!

I was gonna expand it, but I made it really hard to add upon, so I dropped it.
I know it's bad, warning to anyone who wants to look at the code

Progress doesn't save because I couldn't be bothered to save every single variable, idk how to make some sort of loop
all in all,  if you want to try it out, go right ahead.

If you are an actual good dev, pls help or add on to  it.

(p.s please add saving, idk how to)
